This is a remake of the halflife death match map stalkyard. It was made for all the people who love stalkyard and wish to play a map of its style in opposing force. Because I had mad it for opossing force I converted it for halflife death match.  

NOTES
The gluon gun is hidden in the small crate room go to the top of the tallest stack of crates make sure you have a tau cannon too. and break the crates in the corner then go into the hole and get the gluon then tau jump out. 
You can go up on the roof either by taujumping or the vent over a light in the small crate room.  
At least one of every weapon is in this map so if you cant find it keep looking.
