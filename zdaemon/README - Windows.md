# How to create a Zdaemon server on Windows

This readme contains a tutorial, in order to create a Zdaemon server, using a Windows distribution.

Unlike the Linux distribution taking more steps (for security purposes), this one will be both short and extremely easy.

## Downloading Zdaemon

If you have already Zdaemon installed on your system, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, you can download the file at this address: http://zdaemon.org/?CMD=downloads .

Select the current archive ( http://downloads.zdaemon.org/zdaemon110b07_win32_bin.20151014.7z ), and extract it on a folder of your choice.

## Setting everything up

Within your Zdaemon folder, put your IWADs (DOOM2.WAD, DOOM.WAD, PLUTONIA.WAD, TNT.WAD, ...), and if having some, your PWADs.

Now, start ZLauncher, and specify your Zdaemon folder for your wads.

## Using the server wizard

Start Zdaemon Launcher, and go to Server -> Start Server Wizard. A program will open up.
You can also run directly zswizard.exe.

From now on, you can start presets, or create a new one. Just follow the instructions: DMFlags, Servername, port, maplist, and so on.

Once it is done, you can save your preset, and click on "Start Server".
